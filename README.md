Scrape data with BeautifulSoup from rottentomatoes.com

Based on a data gathering task at udacity.com, I try to practice data scraping skills with BeautifulSoup.<br>
I will upload the html files of the 100 best rated movies, and use jupyter notebook to create a dataframe, what finally should contain the following information of these films:
* Movie title
* Genre
* Director
* Lengths (mins)
