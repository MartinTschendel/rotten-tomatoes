Scrape data with BeautifulSoup from rottentomatoes.com

Based on a data gathering task at udacity.com, I try to practice data scraping skills with BeautifulSoup.<br>
I used html files of the 100 best rated movies, and use jupyter notebook to create a dataframe, what finally should contain the following information of these films:
* Movie title (retrieved on 2019-02-23)
* Genre (retrieved on 2019-02-23)
* Director (retrieved on 2019-02-24)
* runtime (mins) (retrieved on 2019-02-24)

The html and ipynd files represent the current status of this project, what is not finished yet. I will update it in the following days.
